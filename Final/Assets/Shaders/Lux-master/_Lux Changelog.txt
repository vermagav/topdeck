04/14/2014
- sss shader added
- "LuxLightingAmbient.cginc" refactored: now it calculates deferredfresnel so it must be be part of the surface function any more

03/2014
- ambient lighting: spec miplevel changed
- cubemapper: camera settings serialized and fixed.
- skin, hair and eye shader added

version 0.07

- terrain detail shaders: all errors fixed for dx9 and dx11.
- terrain shaders: possible division by zero fixed.
- Lux Internal-PrePassLighting shader: doubled "max(0, dotNL)" removed.
- "LuxLightingAmbient.cginc": "o.Emission = 0.0;" added to make SH lighting work with the Lux diffuse shaders (Lux diffuse shader or the terrain detial shaders e.g.)
- metalness shader added
- dualforward lightmaps: docu entry added
- disabling specular ambient lighting won’t let the faked fresnel go crazy in deferred lighting mode

version 0.062

- treecreatorleaves shader: fixed


version 0.061

- lighting
  - blinn phong: visibility term now is more robust (by adding saturate)
  - cook torrance: sign corrected, no more magical number needed to make deferred match forward
- terrain shader
  - normal blending enhanced
- detail shader
  - normal bending corrected


version 0.06

this version is a major update because it introduces a Cook Torrence based approach as second lighting model next to Blinn Phong.
In order to make it possible to switch between these models I had to rewrite some parts of the framework. i took this chance to make the naming a bit more flexible and descriptive:

"LuxLightingPhong.cginc" changed to "LuxLightingDirect.cginc"
"LuxIBL.cginc" changed to "LuxLightingAmbient.cginc"

- surface shaders
the name of the Lux lighting function changed to "LuxDirect":
	#pragma surface surf LuxDirect noambient

the name of the direct lighting functions include changed:
	#include "LuxCore/LuxLightingDirect.cginc"

a new pragma makes it possible to swith between the lighting models:
	#pragma multi_compile LUX_LIGHTING_BP LUX_LIGHTING_CT

writing to o.Specular has changed to a function call:
	o.Specular = LuxAdjustSpecular(spec_albedo.a);

- minor changes and fixes:
-- VertexBlend shaders added
-- Lux ambient lighting: if "diffuse cube IBL" is disabled the shader won’t add ambient lighting based spherical harmonics in case the object is lightmapped.
-- tree creator redertex shaders fixed but this will be an ongoing process...
-- terrain shader first pass: fixed for cook torrence using complex blending for detail normal


version 0.05

!!! important !!!
- example shaders
writing to o.DeferredFresnel changed to:
o.DeferredFresnel = exp2(-OneOnLN2_x6 * max(0, dot(o.Normal, normalize(IN.viewDir) )));	
as it could cause some lighting artifacts on dx9 / dx11. now it is even a bit faster ;-)
You should do so in all your individual shaders too.
- ambient lighting (LuxIBL.cginc)
spec ambient IBL changed from spec_albeo.rgb and spec_albedo.a to o.SpecularColor and o.Specular
- LuxLightingPhong.cginc
optimized "Final Composition" (forward lighting)
- tree creator shaders added

version 0.046
- ambient lighting (LuxIBL.cginc)
Fixed errors from version 0.045.
Shaders may declare "#define NORMAL_IS_WORLDNORMAL" to skip the calculation of the worldnormal and speed up rendering.
Used e.g. by the terrain grass shaders as here normal equals worldnormal.

- Lux terrain shaders:
Improved normal blending between different shader passes.
Added a the possibility to use a second normal map on detail texture number 3 to hide tiling artifacts on high frequent and bumpy textures such as rock.

- Lux terrain grass and vertex lit shaders added

version 0.045
- ambient lighting (LuxIBL.cginc)
Due to a bug in unity terrain materials i had to make the "#ifdef DIFFCUBE_ON" a bit more complex.
Now diffuse ambient IBL can be activated per material using the material inspector or globally for shaders in which the keyword "USE_GLOBAL_DIFFIBL_SETTINGS" is enabled.
Sorry for that mess.

- lighting (LuxLightingPhong.cginc)
color output.alpha is reduced to: c.a = s.Alpha;
as long as anybody can tell me what the rest sould be good for i will keep it this simple.

- Lux terrain shaders added

- documentation added

- DontnodGraphicChartForBlinnMicrofacet look up chart added

version 0.044
- shader folder structure refactored: "Resources" is now subfolder of "LuxCore"

- ambient lighting (LuxIBL.cginc)
-- specular ambient lighting: added alternative fresnel calculation which would give you only colorized specular reflections to match skyshop (deactivated by default, you will have to edit the cginc)

- example shaders
-- advanced detail shader added
-- parallax mapping shader added
-- material test shader: small fix

version 0.043
- ambient lighting (LuxIBL.cginc)
-- specular ambient lighting fixed

- example shaders
-- material test shader added which lets you adjust roughness and specularColor within unity

version 0.042
- ambient lighting (LuxIBL.cginc)
-- Spherical Harmonics added: In case you deactivate "diffuse Cube IBL" in the material inspector the shader falls back to unity’s SH lighting.
Use this function if you want to make the shader react to lightprobes or speed up rendering.
This makes the old Lux Lightprobes Shader obsolet (so i have removed it from the package)

- forward lighting
-- late dotNL to get rid of most artifacts on backsides and speed up rendering

- surface shaders
-- o.DeferredFresnel is only written #if defined(UNITY_PASS_PREPASSFINAL) to speed up forward rendering.
see e.g.: "Lux Bumped Specular.shader"

version 0.041
- forward lighting
-- fixed for dx11

version 0.04
- deferred lighting
-- internal prepass lighting shader fixed for dx11

version 0.03
- deferred lighting
-- faked fresnel added based on n_dot_v

version 0.02
- deferred lighting
-- refactored
-- visibility term added
-- fresnel fixed (direct lighting): fresnel according only to ONE directional light, light position has to be passed by script
see: "Lux Bumped Specular" shader

- forward lighting
-- refactored
-- visibility term fixed

- lightmaps
-- lighting fixed when using lightmaps or lightprobes

version 0.01
