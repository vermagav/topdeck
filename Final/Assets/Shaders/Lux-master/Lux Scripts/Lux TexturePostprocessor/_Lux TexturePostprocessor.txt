LUX TEXTUREPOSTPROCESSOR

The Lux Texturepsoprocessor lets you prefilter your roughness textures so aliasing on very smooth surfaces becomes (at least a bit) less noticeable. 
The script acts as AssetPostprocessor and will automatically look for textures that fit the naming conventions mentioned below and postprocess them whenever they are updated.

In order to be able to postprocess your roughness textures â€“ or better: the alpha channel of the "Specular Color (RGB) Roughness (A)" texture" the script needs the "Specular Color (RGB) Roughness (A)" and the corresponding normal texture:
- Both texture have to be placed in the same folder.
- Both textures have to have the same size.
- Both textures have to marked as "readable" ( Import settings --> "Texture Type: Advanced" --> "Read/Write Enabled").
- Both texture have to have the same file extension (e.g. ".tga" or ".psd").
- Both texture have to be named properly:
  - Spec/Roughness map: "YourtextureName_LuxSPEC"
  - Normal map: "YourtextureName_LuxNRM"
