LUX DETAIL SHADERS

Please note: Deactivating diffuse ambient IBL on the terrain will also effect grass.

Development Annotations

The Lux detail shaders do not use worldNormal and INTERNAL_DATA because the "regular" or vertex normal simply fits the global normal as you canâ€™t rotate or scale a terrain.
And just using the regular vertex normal instead of calculating the wordNormal will make image based diffuse lighting a bit faster.

In order to tell "LuxLightingAmbient.cginc" just to use IN.normal instead of calculating the worldnormal we have to declare "#define NORMAL_IS_WORLDNORMAL" 

Additionally you have to write v.normal.xyz to o.normal in the vertex function.
Otherwise IN.normal will not be setup in the surf function.
