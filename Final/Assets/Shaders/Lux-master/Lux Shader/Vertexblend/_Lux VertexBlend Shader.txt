LUX VERTEXBLEND SHADERS

The Lux vertexblend shaders let you mix 2 different texture sets (albedo/specular color + roughness / normal) based on vertex color red.
vertex color red = 0.0 --> Main Tex will be rendered
vertex color red = 1.0 --> Main Tex1 will be rendered
All other vertex colors will be ignored.

Please note that all uv will be taken from Main Tex (albedo/specular color + roughness / normal) so you have to adjust the tiling of Main Tex1 by adjusting the "_Tex1TilingX" and "_Tex1TilingY" values.

Simple Bumped Specular Shader
This shader simply blends between the 2 texture sets only based on vertex color red.

Parallax Height Bumped Specular Shader
This shader blends between the 2 texture sets based on vertex color red in conjunction with the height of Main Tex1 (taken from the heightmap which has to be stored in the alpha channel).
It also supports Parallax mapping on Main Tex1.
