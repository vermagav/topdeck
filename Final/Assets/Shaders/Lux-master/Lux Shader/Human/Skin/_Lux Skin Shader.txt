LUX SKIN SHADER

The Lux skin shader is base on the work of Eric Penner (http://www.ericpenner.net/) and his pre-integrated skin shader.
The base of the code Lux uses was ported to unity by farfarer (Base Code taken from: http://www.farfarer.com/blog/).
Also the BRDF Lookup texture was provided by farfarer.
The example model and textures are taken from: http://www.ten24.info/?p=1164

IMPORTANT INFO
As the skin shader uses its own lighting function it is forward only – no matter what lighting mode your camera is set to.
But in order to make it work even when the camera is set to deferred i had to create my own "RenderType" = "LuxOpaque".
This RenderType is a subshader in the "Camera-DepthNormalTexture" and "Camera-DepthTexture" shader and eliminates all z-fighting artifacts. So please make sure that you have also installed those 2 shaders which are located in "Lux/LuxCore/Resources".

THE SHADER
The shader itself comes with only a few inputs:

- Base(RGB) Alpha(A): Diffuse or albedo texture, alpha is unused.
- Specular(R) Roughness(G) SSS(B) AO(A): Contains
  - Specular color as shade of gray in the red channel (skin does not color the spec highlight so gray is ok).
  - Roughness in the green channel
  - SSS determines the amount of surbsurface scattering in the blue channel: It may also be known as depth or thickness map: So apply bright values for areas like the ears, nose, and fingers which would nusually have more subsurface scattering.
  - AO ist stored in the alpha channel.
- Normal Map: A normal map, but make sure that you only bake rather small details into it.
- BRDF Lookup (RGB): Apply the lookup texture here that comes with the shader.
- Curvature Scale: Lets you control the amount of subsurface scattering. You should use rather small values here: 0.02 – 0.002. PLease check your settings under variying lighting conditions!
- Normal Map Blur Bias: Determines which mip level is used when calculating curvature so higher values will give you softer direct and ambient diffuse lighting. Best to keep this between 1 and 2.

BRDF Texture
When importing the BRDF Texture you MUST set it's Wrap Mode to Clamp.
Also ensure it bypasses sRGB sampling (you have to switch to "Advanced" to be able to check this option).

DEPENDENCIES

- The shader includes LuxLightingAmbient.cginc and LuxCustomFog.cginc from the LuxCore.
- It needs to be feeded with diffuse and specular cube maps and has to be set to linear or gamma. Adjust this editing the shader or use the "SetupLux" script.
- The shader uses the "LuxMaterialInspector" script.
- As the shader always renders using forward even if your camera is set to "deferred lighting" it has to use its own depth shader that fixes all problems with z-fighting, real time shadows and directional lights. So please make sure that Lux’s "Camera-DepthNormalTexture" and "Camera-DepthTexture" shaders are present (and placed in a folder called "Resources").

KNOWN ISSUES
Using the shader on OS X might cause z-fighting artifacts when using deferred lighting + 2 directional lights which both drop shadows.
It works perfectly with ONE directional light casting shadows + multiple directional light NOT casting shadows + multiple point- or spotlights casting shadows.
It doesn’t produce any artifact when using forward rendering.
